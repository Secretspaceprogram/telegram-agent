# Telegram Agent/RAT
### Info:
This is a Remote Access Tool written in python2 which uses Telegram as its command and control server. The idea behind this tool is that you dont need to deploy a CnC server when starting a 'pentest', you can just install this implant and it will connect to telegram giving you access without the hastle. Esentially acts like a Telegram bot but relays commands.
